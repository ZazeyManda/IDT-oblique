# Before running the algorithm
- The dataset must be stored as a .csv file without spaces between the names of the columns (e.g. X1,X2,X3)
- There must be no missing values or placeholders (such as NUM) that are not yet filled in
- Since the code has been written using version 3.11.2 of Python, this should be installed

# To run the algorithm
- To run the algorithm one is required to go to the directory where 'node.py' is located and run the command 'python3 node.py'
- In the node.py file, the class definition for the Node class lists the exact parameters that are required to run the algorithm
- The example below in node.py can be used to modify for your own use case
